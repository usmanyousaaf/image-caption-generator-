# Image Caption Generator

The Image Caption Generator is an advanced deep learning project that combines computer vision and natural language processing to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. By analyzing the content of the input image, the system generates meaningful textual descriptions that accurately represent the visual content.

## Current Progress
The project is currently under development and aims to deliver a robust and accurate solution. Ongoing efforts include refining the model's performance, optimizing the caption generation process, and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Working Directory Error Soluction
There is a designated working directory where the trained features are stored when you run the project on your local machine. To ensure smooth execution, please create a folder within the working directory specifically for storing the generated features.

## Feedback
